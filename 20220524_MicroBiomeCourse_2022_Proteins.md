# MicrobiomeProteins
Software and data for working with Microbiome Proteins - MicrobiomeCourse2022

##Introduction:
Today, we are going to explore some of the proteins (or gene products, depending on your frame of reference ;) ) that have come out of our initial explorations of the MicroPD 16S dataset, the metabolomics set, and [this](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau6323) paper from the Balskus and Turnbaugh Labs that looks at the interspecies metabolism of L-DOPA to m-tyramine.

I will be introducing tools that are available as web servers, that use a commmand line, scripts, the terminal, that can communicate with R, and combinations of all options. My hope is you will be able to be introduced to many different options and can pick the tool that suits your specific scientific question, whether a simple web tool to see the domains of a representative protein or multiple sequence alignment to a more computationally intensive question that requires scripts and automation.

##Software to Download Prior to Class
Please go to [this](https://cytoscape.org/download.html) site and download Cytoscape 3.9.1 (274 MB for MacOSX, not sure for Windows). Double click on the installer or open the .exe file and follow the installer prompts.

Open RStudio and run the following commands to ensure you are able to access these libraries
