# MicrobiomeProteins
Software and data for working with Microbiome Proteins - MicrobiomeCourse2022

Today, we are going to explore some of the proteins (or gene products, depending on your frame of reference ;) ) that have come out of our initial explorations of the MicroPD 16S dataset, the metabolomics set, and [this] (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau6323) paper from the Balskus and Turnbaugh Labs that looks at the interspecies metabolism of L-DOPA to m-tyramine.
